    """Find the convergence rates along subduction zones over time.
    
    For each time (over a range of times) an output xy file is generated containing the resolved subduction zones
    (with point locations as the first two columns x and y) and the following convergence rate parameters in subsequent columns:
    
      - subducting convergence (relative to overriding plate) velocity magnitude (in cm/yr)
      - subducting convergence velocity obliquity angle (angle between subduction zone normal vector and convergence velocity vector)
      - subduction zone absolute (relative to anchor plate) velocity magnitude (in cm/yr)
      - subduction zone absolute velocity obliquity angle (angle between subduction zone normal vector and absolute velocity vector)
      - length of arc segment (in degrees) that current point is on
      - subducting arc normal azimuth angle (clockwise starting at North, ie, 0 to 360 degrees) at current point
      - subducting plate ID
      - overriding plate ID
    
    The obliquity angles are in the range (-180 180). The range (0, 180) goes clockwise (when viewed from above the Earth) from the
    subducting normal direction to the velocity vector. The range (0, -180) goes counter-clockwise.
    You can change the range (-180, 180) to the range (0, 360) by adding 360 to negative angles.
    
    Note that the convergence velocity magnitude is negative if the plates are diverging (if convergence obliquity angle
    is greater than 90 or less than -90). And note that the absolute velocity magnitude is negative if the subduction zone (trench)
    is moving towards the overriding plate (if absolute obliquity angle is less than 90 or greater than -90) - note that this
    ignores the kinematics of the subducting plate.
    
    Each point in the output is the midpoint of a great circle arc between two adjacent points in the subduction zone polyline.
    The subduction zone normal vector used in the obliquity calculations is perpendicular to the great circle arc of each point (arc midpoint)
    and pointing towards the overriding plate (rather than away from it).
    
    Each subduction zone is sampled at approximately uniform intervals along its length (specified via a threshold sampling distance).
    The sampling along the entire length of a subduction zone is not exactly uniform. Each segment along a subduction zone is sampled
    such that the samples have a uniform spacing that is less than or equal to the threshold sampling distance. However each segment
    in a subduction zone might have a slightly different spacing distance (since segment lengths are not integer multiples of
    the threshold sampling distance).
    
    The subducting arc normal (at each arc segment mid-point) always points *towards* the overriding plate.

    NOTE: Separate the positional and optional arguments with '--' (workaround for bug in argparse module).
